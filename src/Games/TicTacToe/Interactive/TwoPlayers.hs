-- == A "TicTacToe" game for two human players ==

{-
 - The game actually requires both players to pick unique numbers from 1-9 instead classical TicTacToe moves.
 - The first player to pick three number that sum up to 15 wins.
 -
 - This corresponds to labeling the TicTacToe board like so:
 -   X   Y   Z
 - A 8 | 1 | 6
 -  ---|---|--
 - B 3 | 5 | 7
 -  ---|---|--
 - C 4 | 9 | 2
 -
 - (The same embedding of game moves from Games.TicTacToe.Interactive.AgainstCPU is also possible here.)
