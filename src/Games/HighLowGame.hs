{- Basic task:
 - Write a simple guessing game, where the goal
 - is to guess a hidden number. After each guess
 - the program gives a hint, indicating whether
 - the hidden number is higher or lower than the
 - guessed number. When the number is guessed the
 - program outputs the number of guesses the user
 - needed.
 -
 - Similar examples exist in
 -   Soar with Haskell, T. Schrijvers (Chapter 8)
