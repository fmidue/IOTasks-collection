{- Basic task:
 - Write a program that reads in two integers (negative integers too)
 - and prints out their sum. This behavior is repeated until the first
 - of the two numbers read is 0. The program then terminates (not
 - reading a second number), printing the count of additions
 - performed.
 -
 - You can add additional information to both the output of the
 - addition results as well as the final output. Furthermore you might
 - want to add additional outputs to indicate what the user has to do
 - next.
 -
 - Variant:
 -   * no negative numbers are allowed, when read number is negative read
 -     again, until the input is non-negative.

-- recommended settings stdArgs{ maxIterationUnfold = 10, maxNegatives = 2 }
noNegatives :: Specification
noNegatives = specification (nonNeg, UntilValid) (nonNeg, UntilValid)

{- A common error is to also abort on reading 0 for the second number.
 - From the specification alone no special test case is generated for this behavior,
 - therefore the counterexample is likely bigger than one would expect.
 - A second test against a narrower specification can make feedback more precise.
